# Meld - Visual Diff And Merge Tool

https://meldmerge.org

Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for many popular version control systems.

Meld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even help you to figure out what's going on in that merge you keep avoiding.
