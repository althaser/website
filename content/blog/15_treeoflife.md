In order to organise all of the forms of life on earth, scientists created the tree of life. All of the different types of organisms that now live on earth, or that we know once lived on earth, are included in the tree. Every group has its own branch: from mammals (including people) to birds and reptiles And the thick branches fan out into thinner branches for different species.
