**Renovatebot** - Automated Dependency Updates

**Mend Renovate** keeps source code dependencies up-to-date using automated Pull Requests. It will scan repositories for package manager files (e.g. from npm/Yarn, Bundler, Composer, Go Modules, Pip/Pipenv/Poetry, Maven/Gradle, Dockerfile/k8s, and many more), and submit Pull Requests with updated versions whenever they are found.
